### Hi there, I'm Sachin 👋 👨🏻‍💻

I am a computer vision engineer. I finished my M.S in Computer Engineering at San Jose State University in Fall 2020. During my time at university I made use of my projects and coursework to explore and dive deep into how to implement these skills in robotics perception and localization tasks using deep learning and conventional computer vision algorithms. Apart from that I am always on the edge to learn more about new inventions✨.
